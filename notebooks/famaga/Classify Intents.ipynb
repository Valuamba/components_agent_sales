    "Creating an intent tree for an automated sales chatbot involves defining a structured hierarchy of intents (purposes or goals) that represent different user interactions. This tree guides the chatbot in understanding and responding to user queries effectively. Let's outline the steps to build an intent tree for a sales chatbot:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Main Intents:**\n",
    "   - **Product Inquiry:** Questions about products, features, or services.\n",
    "   - **Pricing and Quotes:** Requests for pricing information or specific quotes.\n",
    "   - **Order Processing:** Queries about placing, modifying, or tracking orders.\n",
    "   - **Support and Troubleshooting:** Seeking help for problems or getting answers to questions.\n",
    "   - **General Information:** Questions about the company, policies, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Sub-Intents:**\n",
    "   Each main intent can have several sub-intents. For example:\n",
    "   - **Product Inquiry:**\n",
    "     - Specifications\n",
    "     - Availability\n",
    "     - Compatibility\n",

    "   - **Order Processing:**\n",

    "   - **General Information:**\n",
    "     - Company History\n",
    "     - Operating Hours\n",
    "     - Contact Information\n",

    "     - Technical Specs\n",

    "6. **Plan Responses for Each Intent:**\n",
    "   Design appropriate responses for each intent and sub-intent.\n",
    "   - **Technical Support:** Provide troubleshooting steps or offer to connect with a human agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Implement Feedback Loop:**\n",
    "   Allow users to provide feedback if the response didn’t meet their needs, to improve the chatbot's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Continual Updates and Learning:**\n",
    "   Regularly update the intent tree based on new products, services, and customer interactions.\n",

    "- The client wanted to compare prices\n",
    "  The client requests the same model in different modifications, already realizing that they'll only take one of them. The client simply wants to request prices, compare them and select one. Later, they indicated they'll take these 8, these 20, etc.\n",

    "- The client asks for one item and says they need 20 items and requests a discount. Initially, they deliberately ask for one piece, and then immediately 20 and requests a discount. Regardless, due to the change in quantity, the price will change. AI should warn that reducing the quantity will cause the price to double.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Price Policy\n",
    "- If the supplier is located in the UK or America, the delivery price will vary significantly due to customs, and this will affect the unit price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Offer Constructor\n",
    "- The client had an idea and asked to add something. Remembered that they need to add something.\n",
    "- Making a commercial proposal. Need more info? Send a photo of the product, serial number. About 30% of the requests require client information. The most common requests are either for the serial number or for a photo of the product. Additional options. If it's a programmable product, do you need software? It's necessary to clarify in which field the product will be used: Food Industry, Power Engineering. There are technical questions like air supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manufacturer Communication\n",
    "- If a datasheet is not found: Contacted the manufacturer for the datasheet. The manufacturer may say that the datasheet doesn't exist.\n",

    "### Supplier communication\n",
    "- The supplier said there is no information.\n",
    "  Manager: Made a request for information from the client. In rare cases, they explicitly clarify the client's information. In this case, the client's questions are addressed to the manufacturer. For instance, what does the letter Q mean in the product code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invoicing\n",
    "- Request for an invoice - The client requests an invoice - Go to the client's card - Click the button, an invoice is issued to the client.\n",
    "- What convenient method of payment for the client?\n",
    "  PayPal - we'll ask for the email linked to PayPal\n",

    "  Bank transfer - Currency of transfer - Legal entity address\n",
    "  - Do you need delivery, if it was not previously agreed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handle Customers Refusals\n",
    "- We learn the reason, if it's the price, we return to the discount\n",
    "- Delivery time (4-5 weeks). Ask what time is needed. If it's a factory term, we inform the client of the fact. The client says they need alternatives. The client says that production has stopped for 2 million euros and requests.\n",
    "- The producer takes 2-3 days to issue a commercial proposal if there is no price. Theoretically, this could take 2 weeks. If the price for the commercial proposal is available, it's prepared within one day (a few hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sales Rules\n",
    "- If the deal is less than 10k -- Call within 2 days from the date of sending the commercial proposal.\n",
    "- If the client didn't answer the phone - A template is sent to the email with a notification: KP1, KP2, KP3. If after 3 KPs there is no response, the deal is closed.\n",
    "- If an application has been received - A default response is sent stating that the request is being processed.\n",
    "- The manager has prepared a commercial proposal.\n",
    "  Client: we will respond within a week/soon // ask all technical questions; all technical questions boil down to sending the datasheet. Datasheets are usually found quickly, not for a specific item but for a model range. 60% of them are found.\n",

    "*   **Frequent Buyers**: For clients who purchase for the fifth time, the aim is not to try to make a profit off them, taking into account possible changes in their managers.\n",
    "*   **Brand A Strategy**: For Brand A, where competition is not high, there is a recommended markup in CRM. This can be utilized when the client sees the commercial offer the second or third time.\n",
    "*   **Client Objections**: If a client has objections, the target price is inquired about in percentages or cash.\n",

An experienced sales manager knows such clients and can ignore their messages about the request, as it is done purely for KPI purposes. The sales manager may have called the client to discuss details verbally, but the procurement manager still has to ask for a discount because their messages are read and checked for compliance.\\n\\nHere is the block scheme text description:\\n\\n### Start of the Process\\n\\n- **Client Inquiry**: The client specifies the desired cost that requires a large discount (e.g., 25% off $135,000.00).\\n   - **Action**: The sales manager requests justification for the large discount.\\n   \\n- **Client Justification**: The client provides a reason for the discount, such as finding a cheaper price elsewhere, an error in the part number, or placing a bulk order.\\n   - **Decision Point**: Is the justification relevant?\\n     - **Yes**:\\n       - **Action**: Forward the justification to the manufacturer and request a discount.\\n         - **Manufacturer Response**: \\n           - **Discount Granted**: Send the client a commercial offer with the desired price.\\n           - **Discount Denied**: Lower the margin to 10% and inform the client that this is the maximum discount.\\n     - **No**:\\n       - **End**: Inform the client that the discount cannot be provided and conclude the process.\\n\\n- **Discount Resolution**\\n   - **Decision Point**: Is the discount issue resolved?\\n     - **Yes**: Conclude the discount processing.\\n     - **No**: Return to the start of the cycle with considerations for any changes.\\n\\n### Additional Considerations\\n\\n- **Procurement Managers\\' KPIs**: Sales managers may recognize discount requests as formalities for procurement managers to meet their KPIs and may choose to ignore these requests if they understand them to be procedural rather than genuine.\\n\\n**End of the Process**\\n- **Conclusion**: Finish the discount processing, ensuring all client interactions and justifications are appropriately addressed. \\n```\\n'"
