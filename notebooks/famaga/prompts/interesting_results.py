[CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT]

1. **Thought**: Start the process of handling customer inquiries about product discounts.
2. **Block**: Begin with 'Initial Contact', checking the database for the customer's previous orders.
3. **Decision Point**: Determine whether the customer has previously bought the same product.
4. **Decision Observation**: If yes, consider if the price can be the same as in the previous order while keeping the markup above 10%. If no, move on to the next block.
5. **Block Observation**: Make a price decision based on the customer's history and potential profitability for the company.
6. **Block**: If the customer has not previously bought the same product, proceed to 'Customer Stated Desired Price' and ask the customer for their desired price.
7. **Decision Point**: Check if there's an answer with a specific price.
8. **Decision Observation**: If yes, check if it's possible to set the price to the customer's desired price while keeping the markup above 10%. If no, return to the start of the cycle.
9. **Block Observation**: Make a price decision based on the customer's request and potential profitability for the company.
10. **Block**: If unable to meet the customer's desired price while maintaining a 10% markup, proceed to 'Request Justification' and ask the customer to justify their requested price.
11. **Decision Point**: Determine if the justification is relevant.
12. **Decision Observation**: If yes, forward the justification to the manufacturer and request a discount. If no, return to the start of the cycle.
13. **Block Observation**: Make a decision on further action based on the validity of the customer's justification.
14. **Block**: If the manufacturer grants a discount, send the client a commercial offer with the desired price. If not, lower the margin to 10% and inform the client that this is the maximum discount.
15. **Decision Point**: Determine if the question about the discount is closed.
16. **Decision Observation**: If yes, conclude the discount processing. If no, return to the start of the cycle.
17. **Block Observation**: Close the discount process or restart the cycle based on the customer's response.
18. **Thought**: Complete the process, ensuring all new considerations are accounted for in the cycle.
19. **Final Answer**: The processing of the discount is concluded, and the customer is informed of the outcome.
